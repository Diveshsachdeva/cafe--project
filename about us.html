 <h1><center> Coffee Day, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, is India’s favourite hangout for
     coffee and conversations. Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide the best
      experience to our guests. Our coffees are 
      sourced from thousands of small coffee planters,
       who made us who we are today and we're glad to
        be a part of their lives. We opened our first cafe
         in 1996 at Brigade Road in Bangalore – the youth and
          the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, and it continues to be one of the most happening places in the city. CCD to the youth is a “hangout” spot 
      where they meet people, make conversations, and have a
      whole lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee.It's 
      been an exciting journey since then to becoming the largest 
      organised retail cafe chain in the country.</h1> </center>
